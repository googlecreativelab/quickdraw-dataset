  Demonstration of parsing simplified ndjson files from  Quick, Draw! dataset with node.js.
  Read in all of the simplified drawings into memory and log out some properties.

  https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset
  https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data

  This demo assumes you've put the file "face-simple.ndjson" into a folder called "data"
  in the same directory as this script.
